Subject: [PATCH 16/25] test/linkage-visibility: Ensure symbols are visible to
 dlsym

DynamicLibrary uses libc's dlsym() function internally to find symbols.
Some implementations of dlsym(), like musl's, only look at dynamically-
exported symbols, as found in shared libraries. To also export symbols
from the main executable, pass --export-dynamic to the linker.
